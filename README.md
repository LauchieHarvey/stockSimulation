#Monte carlo simulation of stock price to determine optimal buy/sell strategies.

###The simulation of the stock price
The change in the stock price will be determined as a function of its recent
changes and pseudo-randomness. A stock thats price recently dropped by a lot 
is more likely to drop further in price than a stock that has been stable or
increasing. In this way, the price of the stock will exhibit an inertia like
effect.
